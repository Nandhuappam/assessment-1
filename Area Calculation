Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in a square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input Format

First input: a side of a square in integer Second input: length of a rectangle in integer Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Constraints

1<=side of square <=10**9 1<=length of rectangle<=10**9 1<=breadth of rectangle<=10**9 1<=radius<=10**9

Output Format

The first output should be the area of a square in integer The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

program:-
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int side, length, breadth;
    float radius, areaSquare, areaRectangle, areaCircle;

    
    scanf("%d", &side);
    scanf("%d", &length);
    scanf("%d", &breadth);
    scanf("%f", &radius);

    areaSquare = side * side;
    areaRectangle = length * breadth;
    areaCircle = 3.14 * radius * radius;

    printf("%d\n", (int)areaSquare);
    printf("%d\n", (int)areaRectangle);
    printf("%.2f\n", areaCircle);

    return 0;
}
